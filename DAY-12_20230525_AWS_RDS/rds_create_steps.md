#### RDS MySQL DB Easy Create 
```
To create an RDS MySQL instance using the "Easy Create" option, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

STEP-1 : Open the Amazon RDS console: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/), navigate to the RDS service, and click on "Databases" in the left-hand menu.

STEP-2 : Click on the "Create database" button: On the RDS Databases page, click on the "Create database" button to start the creation process.

STEP-3 : Select the "Easy Create" option: On the "Choose a database creation method" page, select the "Easy Create" tab. This option simplifies the configuration process by providing default settings for most of the parameters.

STEP-4 : Choose the engine and version: Select "MySQL" as the database engine. You can choose the desired MySQL version from the dropdown menu. The latest supported version is recommended unless you have specific requirements.

STEP-5 : Specify the instance specifications: In the "Templates" section, select the appropriate template based on your workload. You can choose between the "Dev/Test" or "Production" templates, which preconfigure settings like instance size, storage type, and allocated storage. You can also customize these settings later if needed.

STEP-6 : Configure settings: Provide a unique "DB instance identifier" for your RDS MySQL instance. This identifier is used to identify the instance within AWS. Set a master username and password to access the database.

STEP-7 : Network settings: Choose the "Default VPC" option if you want the RDS instance to be launched within the default Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Alternatively, you can select a different VPC or create a new one.

STEP-8 : Database options: Specify a name for your database. This is the initial database that will be created when the RDS instance is launched. You can also provide additional database options if required.

STEP-9 : Connectivity: In this section, choose the desired options for publicly accessible settings. By default, new instances are set to not be publicly accessible. You can configure security groups and VPC settings to control access to your RDS instance.

STEP-10 : Additional configuration: Expand the "Additional configuration" section to customize advanced settings if needed. Here, you can configure options like backups, monitoring, maintenance, and other advanced parameters.

STEP-11 : Tags (optional): If you want to add tags to your RDS instance for better organization and resource management, you can specify them in the "Tags" section.

STEP-12 : Review and create: Review all the settings you have provided on the final page. Make sure everything is configured correctly. If necessary, you can go back and edit any of the settings. Once you are ready, click on the "Create database" button.

STEP-13 : Wait for the instance creation: The RDS instance creation process may take several minutes. You can monitor the progress on the RDS console's main page. Once the instance is successfully created, its status will change to "available."

That's it! You have successfully created an RDS MySQL instance using the "Easy Create" option. You can now connect to your instance and start using your MySQL database.
