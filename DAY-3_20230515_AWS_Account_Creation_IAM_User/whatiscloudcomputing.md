#### What is Cloud Computing?

```
- Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing services over the internet. 

- Instead of hosting software, applications, and data on a local server or personal computer, users can access these resources from a remote cloud-based server. 

- This allows for greater flexibility and scalability, as users can quickly and easily scale their computing resources up or down to meet changing demands.


Cloud computing offers many benefits, including lower costs, greater scalability, improved flexibility, and increased accessibility. 

It also allows organizations to reduce their expenses on physical hardware and infrastructure, freeing up resources for other priorities.

#### Types of Cloud Computing Models

Here is a table summarizing the three main types of cloud computing models:

| Cloud Computing Model | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Public Cloud | A cloud computing environment that is owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, who provides computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking infrastructure to multiple customers over the internet. Customers can access these resources on a pay-per-use basis and share them with other customers. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). | 
| Private Cloud | A cloud computing environment that is owned and operated by a single organization, either on-premises or off-premises, that is not shared with other organizations. Private clouds provide greater control, security, and customization compared to public clouds, but can be more expensive to operate and maintain. Private clouds can also be hosted by a third-party cloud provider, in which case they are known as "hosted private clouds." |
| Hybrid Cloud | A combination of public and private cloud models, in which an organization uses a mix of on-premises infrastructure, private cloud services, and public cloud services to meet their computing needs. This model offers greater flexibility and scalability compared to using only one type of cloud model, but can also be more complex to manage and secure. |

#### Types of Cloud Computing Services

- Cloud computing is typically divided into three categories: 
    - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), 
    - Platform as a Service (PaaS), and 
    - Software as a Service (SaaS). 

| Category	| Description | Examples | 
| --- |--- | --- |
| Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) | Cloud service providers offer virtualized computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking infrastructure as a service over the internet. Customers can provision and manage these resources as needed. | Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) |
| Platform as a Service (PaaS) | Cloud service providers offer a complete platform for developing, running, and managing applications over the internet. This includes tools and services for developing, testing, and deploying applications, as well as middleware, databases, and operating systems. | Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk |
| Software as a Service (SaaS) | Cloud service providers offer complete software applications that are hosted and managed on their infrastructure and accessed over the internet. Customers can use the software on a subscription basis, without having to install or manage any software on their own devices. | Salesforce, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 |


#### Why Cloud Computing?

Here is a table summarizing some of the key reasons why organizations choose to adopt cloud computing:

| Benefit	| Description |
| --- | --- |
| Cost Efficiency	| Cloud computing eliminates the need to invest in expensive hardware and infrastructure, as well as ongoing maintenance costs. |
| Scalability	| Cloud computing enables organizations to easily scale their IT resources up or down based on their changing needs. |
| Flexibility	| Cloud computing allows organizations to access their applications and data from anywhere, at any time, on any device with an internet connection. |
| Reliability	| Cloud computing vendors offer high levels of reliability and uptime, with built-in redundancy and disaster recovery options. |
| Security	| Cloud computing vendors employ a range of security measures to protect against data breaches and cyberattacks. |
| Agility	| Cloud computing enables organizations to quickly and easily adopt new technologies and processes, and respond to market changes more rapidly. |
| Collaboration	| Cloud computing enables teams to collaborate more effectively, regardless of their location or device. |
| Innovation	| Cloud computing provides access to cutting-edge technologies and services that would be prohibitively expensive or complex to implement on-premises. |
| Sustainability | Cloud computing can help organizations reduce their carbon footprint and minimize their environmental impact. |
