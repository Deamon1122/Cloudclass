#### AWS Organizations
```
   AWS Organizations is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts within your organization. It simplifies the management of multiple AWS accounts, helps you control access and permissions across those accounts, and provides tools for managing policies and compliance.

   With AWS Organizations, you can create a hierarchy of AWS accounts, known as an organization. The organization is represented as a tree-like structure, where you have a master account at the top and member accounts underneath. The master account has full administrative control over all member accounts and can apply policies and controls across the organization.

   Key features and benefits of AWS Organizations include:
      Consolidated Billing: AWS Organizations enables you to consolidate billing across all member accounts, making it easier to track and manage costs for your organization.

      Account Management: You can create and manage AWS accounts within your organization using AWS Organizations. This allows you to provision new accounts quickly and apply standardized configurations and policies.

      Access Control and Permissions: AWS Organizations allows you to manage access control and permissions across multiple accounts. You can define fine-grained permissions and apply them to individual accounts or groups of accounts within your organization.

      Service Control Policies (SCPs): SCPs are a powerful feature of AWS Organizations that allow you to set fine-grained permissions at the organizational level. You can use SCPs to control which AWS services and features are accessible to member accounts, helping enforce compliance and security policies.

      Cross-Account Resource Sharing: AWS Organizations makes it easy to share resources, such as Amazon S3 buckets or Amazon EC2 instances, between accounts within your organization. This simplifies collaboration and resource utilization across multiple accounts.

      Compliance and Governance: AWS Organizations provides tools for managing compliance and governance within your organization. You can define policies that apply to all member accounts and monitor compliance using AWS Config and AWS CloudTrail.

   Overall, AWS Organizations provides a centralized management platform for organizations with multiple AWS accounts, enabling you to streamline account management, enforce security and compliance policies, and optimize cost management across your organization.

#### AWS IAM Identity Center (Successor to AWS Single Sign-On) :
```
    AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) helps you securely create or connect your workforce identities and manage their access centrally across AWS accounts and applications. IAM Identity Center is the recommended approach for workforce authentication and authorization on AWS for organizations of any size and type.

    - Centrally manage workforce access to multiple AWS accounts and applications

    - Create or connect your workforce identities only once for use across AWS.

    - Centrally manage your workforce access to multiple AWS accounts.

    - Assign user permissions based on common job functions or user attributes.

    - Provide your workforce single sign-on access to cloud applications.
