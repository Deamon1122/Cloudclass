#### Ansible Role

```
Roles
Roles let you automatically load related vars, files, tasks, handlers, and other Ansible artifacts based on a known file structure. After you group your content in roles, you can easily reuse them and share them with other users.

Role directory structure
An Ansible role has a defined directory structure with eight main standard directories. You must include at least one of these directories in each role. You can omit any directories the role does not use. For example:

roles/
    common/               # this hierarchy represents a "role"
        tasks/            #
            main.yml      #  <-- tasks file can include smaller files if warranted
        handlers/         #
            main.yml      #  <-- handlers file
        templates/        #  <-- files for use with the template resource
            ntp.conf.j2   #  <------- templates end in .j2
        files/            #
            bar.txt       #  <-- files for use with the copy resource
            foo.sh        #  <-- script files for use with the script resource
        vars/             #
            main.yml      #  <-- variables associated with this role
        defaults/         #
            main.yml      #  <-- default lower priority variables for this role
        meta/             #
            main.yml      #  <-- role dependencies
        library/          # roles can also include custom modules
        module_utils/     # roles can also include custom module_utils
        lookup_plugins/   # or other types of plugins, like lookup in this case

    webtier/              # same kind of structure as "common" was above, done for the webtier role
    monitoring/           # ""
    fooapp/               # ""


By default Ansible will look in each directory within a role for a main.yml file for relevant content (also main.yaml and main):

tasks/main.yml - the main list of tasks that the role executes.

handlers/main.yml - handlers, which may be used within or outside this role.

library/my_module.py - modules, which may be used within this role (see Embedding modules and plugins in roles for more information).

defaults/main.yml - default variables for the role (see Using Variables for more information). These variables have the lowest priority of any variables available, and can be easily overridden by any other variable, including inventory variables.

vars/main.yml - other variables for the role (see Using Variables for more information).

files/main.yml - files that the role deploys.

templates/main.yml - templates that the role deploys.

meta/main.yml - metadata for the role, including role dependencies and optional Galaxy metadata such as platforms supported.

You can add other YAML files in some directories. For example, you can place platform-specific tasks in separate files and refer to them in the tasks/main.yml file:

# roles/example/tasks/main.yml
- name: Install the correct web server for RHEL
  import_tasks: redhat.yml
  when: ansible_facts['os_family']|lower == 'redhat'

- name: Install the correct web server for Debian
  import_tasks: debian.yml
  when: ansible_facts['os_family']|lower == 'debian'

# roles/example/tasks/redhat.yml
- name: Install web server
  ansible.builtin.yum:
    name: "httpd"
    state: present

# roles/example/tasks/debian.yml
- name: Install web server
  ansible.builtin.apt:
    name: "apache2"
    state: present

```
